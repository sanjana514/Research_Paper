I'll start by analyzing your dataset to understand its structure, column names, and data types. Then, I'll generate the 15 hypotheses with appropriate statistical tests and create roadmaps for each challenge. Let me first inspect your dataset.

Your dataset contains 15 columns, including date, store and product identifiers, inventory levels, sales data, demand forecast, pricing, discounts, weather conditions, promotions, competitor pricing, and seasonality.

### **1. Hypotheses & Statistical Tests**
Here are 15 hypotheses using all columns except `id`, along with appropriate statistical tests:

| #  | Hypothesis | Statistical Test |
|----|-----------|-----------------|
| **1**  | There is a significant correlation between `Inventory Level` and `Units Sold`. | Pearson Correlation |
| **2**  | Higher `Discount` leads to an increase in `Units Sold`. | ANOVA or t-test |
| **3**  | `Demand Forecast` significantly differs by `Region`. | ANOVA |
| **4**  | `Competitor Pricing` impacts `Price` significantly. | Linear Regression |
| **5**  | `Units Ordered` depends on `Seasonality`. | Kruskal-Wallis or ANOVA |
| **6**  | Weather conditions (`Weather Condition`) impact `Units Sold`. | Chi-Square Test |
| **7**  | Sales (`Units Sold`) increase during `Holiday/Promotion` periods. | t-test |
| **8**  | `Inventory Level` significantly influences `Demand Forecast`. | Pearson Correlation |
| **9**  | `Price` has a significant effect on `Units Sold`. | Linear Regression |
| **10**  | `Seasonality` affects `Discount` levels. | ANOVA |
| **11**  | `Demand Forecast` accuracy differs based on `Category`. | RMSE comparison |
| **12**  | The impact of `Competitor Pricing` on `Units Sold` varies across `Regions`. | Two-way ANOVA |
| **13**  | `Weather Condition` affects `Inventory Level` patterns. | Chi-Square Test |
| **14**  | `Holiday/Promotion` days have significantly higher `Units Ordered`. | t-test |
| **15**  | Dynamic pricing strategies based on `Demand Forecast` improve revenue. | A/B Testing |

### **2. Roadmaps for Each Challenge**
#### **Challenge 1: Time Series Demand Forecasting (LSTM Model)**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:** Predict daily product demand using past sales and inventory data.

**Roadmap:**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert `Date` to datetime format.
   - Sort data by `Store ID`, `Product ID`, and `Date`.
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Normalize numerical features (`Inventory Level`, `Units Sold`, `Price`, etc.).
   - Encode categorical variables (`Category`, `Region`, `Seasonality`).
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create lag features (`Units Sold` in previous days).
   - Incorporate `Seasonality`, `Weather Condition`, and `Holiday/Promotion` as external factors.
3. **Train Baseline Models**
   - Implement ARIMA & SARIMA models for benchmarking.
   - Compare performance using RMSE and MAE.
4. **Build LSTM Model**
   - Create a time-series dataset with sliding windows.
   - Train LSTM with features: `Units Sold`, `Price`, `Discount`, `Competitor Pricing`, etc.
   - Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search.
5. **Evaluate & Optimize**
   - Compare with classical models.
   - Test robustness using cross-validation.
   - Deploy model for real-time forecasting.

#### **Challenge 2: Inventory Optimization**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:** Reduce stockouts and overstock situations by analyzing trends.

**Roadmap:**
1. **Data Understanding**
   - Analyze `Inventory Level`, `Units Sold`, and `Units Ordered` trends.
   - Identify seasonal demand fluctuations.
2. **Stockout & Overstock Analysis**
   - Calculate stockout rates (days with zero inventory but positive demand).
   - Measure overstock costs (excess inventory held).
3. **Demand-Supply Modeling**
   - Use demand forecasting models (from Challenge 1).
   - Estimate ideal reorder points.
4. **Optimization Model**
   - Implement an EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) model.
   - Use Reinforcement Learning for adaptive restocking.
5. **Automation & Monitoring**
   - Develop a dashboard for real-time inventory alerts.
   - Apply continuous learning to adjust reorder strategies.

#### **Challenge 3: Dynamic Pricing**
ðŸ“Œ **Objective:** Maximize revenue by adjusting prices based on demand and competition.

**Roadmap:**
1. **Data Analysis**
   - Understand how `Price`, `Discount`, and `Competitor Pricing` impact `Units Sold`.
   - Identify price elasticity using regression models.
2. **Market Segmentation**
   - Group products by price sensitivity.
   - Define high-demand vs. low-demand items.
3. **Build Pricing Model**
   - Train a Machine Learning model (XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict sales at different price points.
   - Implement Reinforcement Learning (Multi-Armed Bandit) for real-time pricing adjustments.
4. **Deploy & Monitor**
   - A/B test pricing strategies.
   - Automate price updates based on competitor price movements.
5. **Optimize**
   - Use Bayesian optimization for fine-tuning.
   - Monitor revenue impact and iterate.
